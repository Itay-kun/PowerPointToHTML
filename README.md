i've made this project to help me convert a 100 slides PowerPoint to an interactive website.
some (maybe most?) of the functions are specific to my file format but if someone fineds it helpfull and want to help me generalise it i will be very glad ðŸ™‚

the main function is "ExportWithNavigation" and it does everything.

features i want to add at some point:
1. better conversion for flow charts
2. conversion for tables with merged cells
3. naming the slide acording to the H1 and not by slide number
4. adding breadcrums to each slide based on the category/folder/main page
5. adding search (by keywords) for each slide in the main navigation page
